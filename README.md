# Global Environmental Health Index

**data as empathy.** a visual + ml exploration of how environmental stress (co₂, pollution) relates to human health (life expectancy).

## Quick Start
```bash
# 1) Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2) Prepare directories for data and output
mkdir -p data output

# 3) Build the dataset
python scripts/build_dataset.py

# 4) Launch the dashboard
streamlit run app.py
```

## Project Overview
The Environmental Health Index explores the intersection between environmental quality and human well-being through data.
It visualizes how pollution, CO₂ emissions, and air quality correlate with life expectancy and public health outcomes across countries and over time.

This project aims to turn environmental statistics into empathy-driven insights — helping policymakers, researchers, and the public understand how planetary health mirrors human health.

## Why It Matters

Climate change, pollution, and resource loss are not only environmental problems but public health crises.
By linking ecological data to human outcomes, this project reframes sustainability as a health imperative —
showing that protecting the planet is inseparable from protecting ourselves.
