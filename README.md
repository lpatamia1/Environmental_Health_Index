## Project Overview

The Environmental Health Index explores the intersection between environmental quality and human well-being through data.
It visualizes how pollution, CO₂ emissions, and air quality correlate with life expectancy and public health outcomes across countries and over time.

This project aims to turn environmental statistics into empathy-driven insights — helping policymakers, researchers, and the public understand how planetary health mirrors human health.

## 🚀 Next Steps

</div>

- 🌿 **Add Correlation Heatmaps** — Visualize relationships between pollution, CO₂, and life expectancy.
- 🧠 **Integrate ML Models** — Predict life expectancy shifts under future emission scenarios.
- 🌍 **Include Geographic Mapping** — Use GeoPandas or Folium for country-level visualization.
- 📊 **Enhance Dashboard UI** — Add filters by year, region, or metric category.
- ☁️ **Deploy Online** — Publish via Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces for public access.

## Why It Matters

</div>

- Climate change, pollution, and resource loss are not only environmental problems but public health crises.
- By linking ecological data to human outcomes, this project reframes sustainability as a health imperative — showing that protecting the planet is inseparable from protecting ourselves.
